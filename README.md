The Huntmaster Audio Engine is a cross-platform C++ audio analysis engine designed to be the core of the Huntmaster platform. Its primary function is to analyze and compare audio recordings of animal calls, such as deer grunts or turkey gobbles, by providing a similarity score. It is built to be a self-contained, high-performance static library that can be easily integrated into various client applications (desktop, mobile, etc.).

## üöß Project Status: In Development

This engine is currently under active development for its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The core architecture is in place, and development is focused on implementing the master call processing pipeline.

### Phase 1: Game Calls MVP

‚úÖ Sprint 1: Environment & Core Dependencies (100%)

üöß Sprint 2: Master Call Pipeline & Feature Extraction (50%)

‚è≥ Sprint 3: Real-time Processing & DTW Comparison (0%)

‚è≥ Sprint 4: API Implementation & Unit Testing (25%)

‚è≥ Sprint 5: Build System & Integration Prep (25%)

## ‚ú® Features

MFCC Extraction: Converts raw audio signals into Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, a standard representation for audio feature analysis.

Offline Processing: Designed to pre-process and store feature data from master call audio files.

Real-time Analysis: (In Progress) Will support processing live audio chunks from a microphone.

Audio Comparison: (In Progress) Will use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compare the features of a user's call against a master call.

Cross-Platform: Built with CMake to support compilation across different operating systems.

Static Library: Designed to be compiled into a .lib or .a file for easy integration with other projects.

## Dependencies

This project uses git submodules for external dependencies:

- **KissFFT**: Fast Fourier Transform library (`libs/kissfft`)
- **GoogleTest**: Testing framework (`tests/lib/googletest`)
- **Google Benchmark**: Performance benchmarking library (`tests/lib/benchmark`)
- **Emscripten SDK**: WebAssembly compilation (`tools/emsdk`)

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.16 or higher
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2019+)
- Git (for submodule management)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone with all dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/tescolopio/huntmaster-engine.git
   cd huntmaster-engine
   ```

2. **Configure and build:**

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -DHUNTMASTER_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DHUNTMASTER_BUILD_TOOLS=ON
   cd build
   make  # or 'cmake --build .' on Windows
   ```

3. **Run tests:**

   ```bash
   ./RunEngineTests
   ```

4. **Run performance benchmarks:**

   ```bash
   ./tests/benchmarks/RunBenchmarks
   ```

### Submodule Management

If you've already cloned without `--recursive`:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To update dependencies to latest versions:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --recursive
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: Update submodules to latest versions"
```

### Troubleshooting

**Build fails with missing headers?**

```bash
git submodule status
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Audio tests failing with ALSA errors in WSL?**

This is expected! Audio hardware tests automatically skip in headless environments (WSL/CI/Docker). You'll see messages like:

```text
ALSA lib confmisc.c:855:(parse_card) cannot find card '0'
```

These tests will be marked as SKIPPED and won't affect your build.

**Want to use a specific version of a dependency?**

```bash
cd libs/kissfft
git checkout <specific-tag-or-commit>
cd ../..
git add libs/kissfft
git commit -m "chore: Pin KissFFT to specific version"
```

### Cloning with Submodules

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tescolopio/huntmaster-engine.git

# Or if already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
