## üèÜ Key Achievements Since Last Review

1. **RealtimeAudioProcessor** - Lock-free ring buffer implementation
2. **DTWComparator** - Modern C++20 implementation
3. **MFCCProcessor** - Fully implemented with PIMPL
4. **WASMInterface** - Modern emscripten bindings
5. **Project Structure** - Organized into core/platform directories

## üöß Critical Path Items

1. **Unit Test Coverage** - Need tests for new components
2. **Integration Testing** - No end-to-end tests yet
3. **WASM Build** - Not fully functional
4. **Platform Bridges** - Zero progress on mobile

## üìù Architecture Notes

The codebase now has excellent foundations:

- Clean separation between interface and implementation
- Consistent use of PIMPL pattern
- Modern C++20 features throughout
- Good error handling with huntmaster::expected
- Thread-safe design with appropriate synchronization

The main challenge now is integration and testing rather than core implementation.

<explanation>
The project has made substantial progress since the last review:

**Major Improvements:**

1. **Real-time Pipeline (85% complete)** - The addition of `RealtimeAudioProcessor` with a lock-free ring buffer is a significant achievement
2. **Core Components** - All major DSP components (MFCC, DTW, VAD) are now implemented with modern C++20
3. **Architecture** - The codebase has been restructured with clean separation and consistent patterns

**Key Additions:**

- `RealtimeAudioProcessor` - Lock-free audio processing
- `DTWComparator` - Modern replacement for DTWProcessor
- Improved `WASMInterface` with emscripten bindings
- Better project structure with core/platform separation

**Current State:**

- The project has moved from ~45% to ~60% completion
- Core architecture is essentially complete
- Real-time processing pipeline is mostly implemented
- Testing infrastructure exists but needs expansion

**Next Critical Steps:**

1. Complete integration between components
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for new components
3. Fix WASM build and web demo
4. Begin platform-specific implementations

The project is now at a crucial integration phase where the individual components need to be fully connected and tested as a system.
