auto engineResult = UnifiedAudioEngine::create();
auto engine = std::move(engineResult.value);

auto sessionResult = engine->createSession(44100.0f);
SessionId session = sessionResult.value;

// Thread-safe multi-session processing
engine->loadMasterCall(session, "deer_grunt");
engine->processAudioChunk(session, audioBuffer);
auto score = engine->getSimilarityScore(session);

engine->destroySession(session);
```
