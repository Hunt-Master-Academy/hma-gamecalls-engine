# Project Reorganization Complete ✅

## Summary

The Huntmaster Audio Engine project has been successfully reorganized into a professional directory structure. All scripts, documentation, and configuration files have been updated to work with the new organization.

## What Was Reorganized

### 🗂️ Script Organization

- **Created**: `scripts/` directory with organized subdirectories:
  - `scripts/build/` - Build and deployment scripts
  - `scripts/testing/` - Test execution scripts
  - `scripts/development/` - Development tools
  - `scripts/utilities/` - Utility scripts (ready for future use)

### 📁 Scripts Moved and Updated

| Script                    | Old Location | New Location           | Status     |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| `build_wasm.sh`           | root         | `scripts/build/`       | ✅ Updated |
| `test_build.sh`           | root         | `scripts/build/`       | ✅ Updated |
| `setup-web-deployment.sh` | root         | `scripts/build/`       | ✅ Created |
| `master_test.sh`          | root         | `scripts/testing/`     | ✅ Updated |
| `comprehensive_test.sh`   | root         | `scripts/testing/`     | ✅ Updated |
| `component_test.sh`       | root         | `scripts/testing/`     | ✅ Updated |
| `pre_wasm_validation.sh`  | root         | `scripts/testing/`     | ✅ Updated |
| `generate_docs.sh`        | root         | `scripts/development/` | ✅ Updated |
| `format_code.sh`          | root         | `scripts/development/` | ✅ Updated |
| `debug_test.sh`           | root         | `scripts/development/` | ✅ Updated |

### 📚 Documentation Reorganization

- **Consolidated**: Multiple scattered documentation files into organized `docs/` directory
- **Created**: Unified documentation files:
  - `docs/TESTING.md` - Complete testing guide
  - `docs/MVP_COMPLETION.md` - MVP validation report
- **Removed**: Duplicate and empty documentation files
- **Updated**: `docs/README.md` with new structure index

### 🔧 Configuration Updates

- **Doxyfile**: Updated INPUT paths for new documentation structure
- **README.md**: Updated script references to new paths
- **All Scripts**: Added proper PROJECT_ROOT path handling

### 🆕 New Scripts Created

- **`setup-web-deployment.sh`**: Comprehensive web deployment automation
- **`serve_production.py`**: Production-ready server with security headers

## Path Updates Applied

### All Scripts Now Include:

```bash
# Get script directory and project root
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/../.." && pwd)"
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```

### Script Cross-References Updated:

- `master_test.sh` → Uses `$SCRIPT_DIR/` for other testing scripts
- `setup-web-deployment.sh` → References `$SCRIPT_DIR/build_wasm.sh`
- All documentation → Updated to use `scripts/category/script.sh` format

## Verification Status

### ✅ Completed Updates:

1. **Path Handling**: All scripts use proper relative paths from new locations
2. **Cross-References**: Scripts correctly reference other moved scripts
3. **Documentation**: All references updated to new paths
4. **Configuration**: Doxyfile updated for new documentation structure
5. **Build System**: CMake and build processes unaffected by reorganization

### 🧪 Ready for Testing:

- All scripts are executable and have proper paths
- Documentation is consolidated and accessible
- Build and test automation is intact
- WASM deployment pipeline is ready

## Usage Examples

### Testing (from project root):

```bash
# Full test suite
./scripts/testing/master_test.sh

# Component testing
./scripts/testing/component_test.sh engine

# Build validation
./scripts/build/test_build.sh
```

### Development (from project root):

```bash
# Format code
./scripts/development/format_code.sh

# Generate documentation
./scripts/development/generate_docs.sh

# Debug tests
./scripts/development/debug_test.sh
```

### Deployment (from project root):

```bash
# Build WASM
./scripts/build/build_wasm.sh

# Setup web deployment
./scripts/build/setup-web-deployment.sh --build-wasm --serve
```
