# Memory Protection Plan (Game Calls Engine)

Related code: [`src/security/memory-guard.cpp`](../src/security/memory-guard.cpp)

## Goals
- Enforce DEP/NX, ASLR, SSP, CFI (platform-dependent).
- Memory tagging/isolation for pools; leak detection; audit trails.

## Plan
- Build flags: -fstack-protector-strong, -fstack-clash-protection, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, PIE/RELRO.
- Runtime guards: canaries, guard pages, hardened alloc hooks.
- Telemetry: violations, allocation anomalies, leak counters.

## Validation
- Unit tests for guard activation; fuzz harness; sanitizers (ASan/UBSan).
- Reports via `AuditLogger::generateAuditReport`.

## Rollout
- Start with build flags + runtime canaries; add tagging on supported targets.

## Implementation Checklist

### Build System
- [ ] Add hardening flags to CMakeLists.txt
- [ ] Configure sanitizer builds for CI
- [ ] Enable stack protection
- [ ] Configure FORTIFY_SOURCE

### Runtime Protection
- [ ] Implement memory pool isolation
- [ ] Add guard page allocation
- [ ] Implement canary checking
- [ ] Add allocation tracking

### Monitoring
- [ ] Memory violation telemetry
- [ ] Leak detection reporting
- [ ] Performance impact metrics
- [ ] Security event logging

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for memory guards
- [ ] Fuzzing harness setup
- [ ] Memory safety validation
- [ ] Performance regression tests
