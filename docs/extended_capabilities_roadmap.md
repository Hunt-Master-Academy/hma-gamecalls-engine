## Implementation Guidelines

### **Development Standards:**
1. **Performance First:** All new features must maintain <12ms streaming path
2. **Testing Comprehensive:** Each feature requires unit + integration + performance tests
3. **Documentation Synchronized:** Update MVP todo before implementation begins
4. **Backwards Compatible:** No breaking changes to existing API
5. **Incremental Delivery:** Features delivered in working increments

### **Code Patterns:**
```cpp
// Extended capability factory pattern
class PitchMasterySuite {
public:
 static Result<std::unique_ptr<PitchMasterySuite>> create(
 const PitchMasteryConfig& config);

 // Micro-analysis methods
 Result<MicroDriftMetrics> analyzeDrift(std::span<const float> pitchTrajectory);
 Result<OnsetGlideMetrics> analyzeOnsetGlide(std::span<const float> audio);
 Result<VibratoQualityMetrics> analyzeVibratoQuality(const VibratoData& vibrato);
};
```

### **Performance Monitoring:**
- **Micro-benchmarks:** Each new component measured in isolation
- **Integration impact:** Combined path timing validated
- **Memory footprint:** Session memory usage tracked
- **Regression detection:** Automated performance guard failures

## Success Metrics

### **Quantitative Targets:**
- **Performance:** New features add <2ms to processing path
- **Accuracy:** Feature outputs correlate >90% with expert assessment
- **Stability:** Metrics show <5% variance across repeated analysis
- **Coverage:** All new features covered by comprehensive test suites

### **Qualitative Goals:**
- **Coaching Value:** Features provide actionable improvement guidance
- **User Experience:** Complex analysis presented through clear metrics
