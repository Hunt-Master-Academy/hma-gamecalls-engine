## 🔑 Key Concepts Across All Docs

### 1. **Microservices Pattern** (Hunt Strategy Reference)
The GameCalls Engine follows the same proven pattern as Hunt Strategy Engine:
- C++ core → Node-API bindings → Express REST API → API Gateway → Clients
- Reference implementation: `/home/xbyooki/projects/hma-hunt-strategy-engine/backend/`

### 2. **Dual-Mode Operation**
Both engines support two operational modes:
- **Educational Mode**: HMA Academy lessons (deterministic, reproducible)
- **Field Mode**: HMFG real-world use (adaptive, real-time)

### 3. **Session Lifecycle**
GameCalls sessions follow this pattern:
1. Create session (`POST /gamecalls/sessions`)
2. Stream analysis (`POST /sessions/:id/analyze` - repeat)
3. Finalize (`POST /sessions/:id/finalize`)
4. Get results (`GET /sessions/:id/results`)
5. Destroy (`DELETE /sessions/:id`)

### 4. **Academy Integration**
Deep integration with HMA Academy for lessons:
- Lesson-specific sessions
- Progress tracking
- Achievement awards
- Coaching feedback

### 5. **Hybrid Mobile Approach**
HMFG uses both REST and native:
- **REST API**: For lessons and analytics (when online)
- **Native C++**: For real-time field use (offline-capable)
