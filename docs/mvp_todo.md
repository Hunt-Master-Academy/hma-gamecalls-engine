---

## 🚨 **CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

### File Coordination
- **CMakeLists.txt:** QA Team owns test integration section (lines 10-95)
- **Source Files:** Component teams own respective areas
- **Documentation:** Doc Team coordinates all updates
- **Tests:** QA Team coordinates integration, Component teams own test content

### Merge Strategy
- **Feature Branches:** Required for all changes
- **Test Integration:** Small atomic PRs (1-3 files max)
- **Infrastructure:** Separate PRs, coordinate with all teams
- **Critical Path:** TestUtils.h creation has priority

| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| pitchGrade C or worse                 | Deviation > 25 cents median | “Stabilize pitch at call onset.”        |
| cadenceGrade B but tempo var > target | Inter-onset CV > threshold  | “Consistent spacing needed.”            |
| loudnessDeviation > +20%              | RMS mismatch positive       | “Reduce volume for tonal clarity.”      |
| harmonicGrade low & pitch good        | Spectral roughness high     | “Tone rough—focus on smoother airflow.” |

## 15. Documentation Tasks (Parallel)

| Doc                       | Update                                               |

---

## 16. Out-of-Scope (For Now)

- Cloud synchronization
- CMS ingestion
- AI narrative generation
- Gamified scoring loops
- Mobile platform energy tuning

These depend on stable finalized metrics and calibration pipeline.

---

## 17. Exit Criteria for Current Phase

All of the following:

1. finalizeSessionAnalysis implemented & tested (segment + refined DTW).
2. No skipped tests; readiness API drives assertions.
3. Loudness normalization & deviation metric in summary.
4. Calibration grades (pitch/harmonic) appear & stable.
5. Overlay export available (engine data format).
6. Virtual clock removes sleep delays.
7. Performance thresholds maintained (<12 ms streaming path).
8. README + mvp_todo reflect new APIs & metrics.

## 19. Notes & Constraints

- Maintain zero-copy spans (no buffering copies beyond existing MFCC windows).
- Finalize must not mutate original raw audio (analysis-only transformations).
- Normalization scalar applied only in analysis domain (not persisted).
- Grades must be reproducible (no random seeds).
- Keep finalize idempotent; repeat calls return last computed metrics.

## 20. Diagnostics & Instrumentation (Active)

| Aspect                         | Detail                                                                                               | Gating                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Component Breakdown            | offsetComponent, dtwComponent, meanComponent, subsequenceComponent added to SimilarityScoresSnapshot | Disabled when HUNTMASTER_DISABLE_DIAGNOSTIC_COMPONENTS defined |
| Finalize Fallback Flag         | finalizeFallbackUsed true if finalize raised similarity from <0.70 to >=0.70                         | Same diagnostics gating macro                                  |
| Realtime Readiness             | SimilarityRealtimeState (framesObserved, minFramesRequired, reliable, provisionalScore)              | Always on (planned stable API)                                 |
| Test Hook: Override Similarity | testOverrideLastSimilarity(SessionId,float) simulates low realtime similarity pre-finalize           | Compiled only with HUNTMASTER_TEST_HOOKS=1                     |
| Accessor: Fallback Used        | getFinalizeFallbackUsed(SessionId) returns `Result<bool>`                                            | Always available                                               |

Implementation Notes:

- Test build propagates HUNTMASTER_TEST_HOOKS to library target to emit hook symbols.
- finalizeSessionAnalysis captures preFinalizeSimilarity then performs refinement; flag set only if threshold crossing occurs.
- Positive & negative tests validate fallback instrumentation behavior.
- Diagnostic fields appended after core scores to minimize ABI churn when disabled.

Planned Enhancements:

1. Timing counters for finalize sub-steps (segment selection, refined DTW) – gated.
2. Optional JSON diagnostic snapshot export – gated.
3. Per-component normalization weights exposure (read-only) – gated.

Exit Criteria:

- [ ] Fallback flag reliably set only on genuine improvements (≥3 scenarios)
- [x] Readiness API removes similarity-related test skips
- [ ] Build passes with diagnostics disabled and enabled

Readiness Gates (must all be GREEN to begin Extended Buckets):

1. **Test Coverage Achievement**: 90% line coverage with comprehensive test suites integrated (ACTIVE)
2. Current phase exit criteria fully met (Section 17).
3. All new metrics documented & frozen (no structural changes for 2 consecutive sprints).
4. Performance guard adherence verified under stress (multi-session load).
5. Calibration variance within target (<10% of band width drift across test corpus).


Sequencing Suggestion (Macro): Pitch Mastery → Cadence Precision Lab → Harmonic Richness Explorer → Fusion Similarity Enhancements → Loudness Dynamics → Adaptive Difficulty → Library Intelligence → Cloud & Sync → AI Coaching Semantics → Mobile Optimization.

## 22. Summary

**Current Phase: Test Coverage Expansion (ACTIVE)**

Core engine & enhanced analyzers are stable and production-ready. The current critical focus is achieving comprehensive test coverage to ensure system reliability and maintainability.

**Test Coverage Achievements:**
- Test count expanded from 171 to 321+ (88% increase)
- Comprehensive test suites integrated for all major components
- Coverage measurement infrastructure working (0.5% baseline established)
- Systematic approach targeting highest-impact 0% coverage files

**Next Critical Milestone:** 90% line coverage completion gates the transition to Extended Capability Development

**Post-Coverage Evolution:** User-practice fidelity enhancement through segmentation, readiness clarity, loudness normalization, calibrated confidence → actionable coaching. This TODO enumerates the focused path to deliver a cohesive, low-latency, instruction-ready analysis loop without scope creep into later phase cloud or gamification tiers.

**Coverage-First Strategy:** Ensures robust foundation before extended capabilities, preventing technical debt accumulation and maintaining deployment confidence.
