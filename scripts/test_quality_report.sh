echo "1. 🧹 IMMEDIATE CLEANUP (High Priority)"
echo "   Commands to run:"
echo "   ./scripts/cleanup_test_files.sh --execute"
echo "   Expected Impact: Remove $problem_files problematic files"
echo "   Time Required: 5 minutes"

echo "2. 📊 QUALITY VALIDATION (Medium Priority)"
echo "   Commands to run:"
echo "   ./scripts/validate_test_completeness.sh"
echo "   ninja -C build/debug && timeout 60 ./build/debug/bin/RunEngineTests"
echo "   Expected Impact: Verify no regressions after cleanup"
echo "   Time Required: 10 minutes"
echo

echo "3. 📈 COVERAGE ANALYSIS (Medium Priority)"
echo "   Commands to run:"
echo "   ./scripts/measure_coverage.sh"
echo "   Expected Impact: Baseline coverage metrics"
echo "   Time Required: 15 minutes"
echo

echo "4. 📝 CONTENT ENHANCEMENT (Low Priority)"
echo "   Focus Areas:"
echo "   - Expand minimal test files (<10 lines) to comprehensive tests"
echo "   - Add missing test assertions to partial files"
echo "   - Implement missing security and edge case tests"
echo "   Expected Impact: Improve overall test quality and coverage"
echo "   Time Required: 2-4 hours"
echo

echo "🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA"
echo "=================="
echo "✅ All tests pass after cleanup"
echo "✅ No empty or redirect files remain"
echo "✅ Quality score improves to >90%"
echo "✅ Build system compiles without warnings"
echo "✅ Test execution time remains <60 seconds"
echo

echo "📞 NEXT ACTIONS"
echo "==============="
echo "1. Review this report with the team"
echo "2. Execute immediate cleanup if approved"
echo "3. Validate changes with test run"
echo "4. Plan content enhancement work"
echo "5. Schedule regular quality reviews"
