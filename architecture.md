## Huntmaster Audio Engine - Architecture Overview

### Executive Summary

The Huntmaster Audio Engine is a modern, cross-platform C++ library designed for real-time audio analysis and comparison, specifically optimized for wildlife call training. The engine provides consistent, high-performance audio processing across mobile (iOS/Android), web (WebAssembly), and desktop platforms while maintaining a single, unified codebase.

### Core Design Principles

#### 1. **Modern C++ Standards (C++20/23)**

The engine leverages cutting-edge C++ features for safety, performance, and expressiveness:

- **`huntmaster::expected<T, E>`** - Type-safe error handling without exceptions
- **`std::span<T>`** - Non-owning views of contiguous memory
- **`std::concepts`** - Compile-time interface constraints
- **`std::memory_resource`** - Custom memory allocation strategies
- **`std::shared_mutex`** - Reader-writer lock patterns
- **`std::atomic` & `std::semaphore`** - Lock-free concurrent programming

#### 2. **Interface-Driven Architecture**

- `IHuntmasterEngine.h` defines the contract that all platform implementations must fulfill
- Enables testing with mock implementations
- Facilitates platform-specific optimizations while maintaining API consistency

#### 3. **Memory-Efficient Real-Time Processing**

- **AudioBufferPool**: Pre-allocated memory pools to avoid allocation during audio processing
- Zero-copy operations using `std::span` for audio data
- Lock-free data structures for minimal latency

#### 4. **Platform Abstraction Layer**

### Component Responsibilities

#### **HuntmasterEngine** (Orchestrator)

- Session management with thread-safe containers
- Coordinates the audio processing pipeline
- Maintains master call reference data
- Platform-agnostic core logic

#### **VoiceActivityDetector** (VAD)

- Identifies meaningful audio segments
- Filters out silence and noise
- Reduces unnecessary processing
- Energy-based and statistical detection methods

#### **MFCCProcessor** (Feature Extraction)

- Converts raw audio to Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
- Implements caching for repeated analysis
- Optimized with SIMD when available
- Consistent results across all platforms

#### **DTWComparator** (Pattern Matching)

- Dynamic Time Warping algorithm for audio comparison
- Handles temporal variations in audio
- Returns similarity scores
- Configurable comparison parameters

#### **RealtimeAudioProcessor** (Stream Handler)

- Manages audio chunk queuing
- Provides backpressure mechanisms
- Adapts to platform threading models
- Maintains timing and synchronization

#### **AudioBufferPool** (Memory Manager)

- Pre-allocated buffer management
- Lock-free allocation in hot paths
- Automatic buffer recycling
- Prevents memory fragmentation

### Error Handling Philosophy

The engine uses `huntmaster::expected<T, Error>` throughout, providing:

- No hidden control flow (no exceptions in audio path)
- Explicit error propagation
- Rich error information
- Compile-time safety

Example:

```cpp
huntmaster::expected<FeatureVector, MFCCError> result = mfccProcessor.extractFeatures(audioSpan);
if (!result) {
    // Handle specific error
    switch (result.error()) {
        case MFCCError::INVALID_INPUT: //...
        case MFCCError::FFT_FAILED: //...
    }
}
```

### Threading Model

The engine supports multiple threading models through conditional compilation:

1. **Multi-threaded (Native platforms)**

   - Lock-free queues for audio chunks
   - Reader-writer locks for session data
   - Worker threads for parallel processing

2. **Single-threaded (WebAssembly)**
   - Simplified queue implementations
   - Synchronous processing
   - Browser event loop integration

### Testing Strategy

The architecture facilitates comprehensive testing:

- **Unit tests**: Each component in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Complete audio pipeline
- **Platform tests**: Platform-specific behavior
- **Performance benchmarks**: Real-time constraints validation

### Building and Deployment

- **CMake-based**: Unified build system across platforms
- **Conditional compilation**: Platform-specific optimizations
- **Static library**: Easy integration into host applications
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only KissFFT for FFT operations

### Future Extensibility

The architecture supports future enhancements:

- Additional audio analysis algorithms
- New platform targets
- Hardware acceleration (GPU/DSP)
- Cloud-based processing options
- Machine learning integration

### Conclusion

The Huntmaster Audio Engine exemplifies modern C++ design patterns while solving real-world audio processing challenges. Its architecture balances performance, portability, and maintainability, enabling wildlife enthusiasts to improve their calling techniques across any device they choose to use.
